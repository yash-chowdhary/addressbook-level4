== PROJECT: Club Connect

== Overview

*Club Connect* is an application targeted at <<DeveloperGuide#club,club>> <<DeveloperGuide#member,members>> who are students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to make the tedious process of club management easier and more effective.

*Club Connect* is an application that a user who loves to type would fancy - in other words, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). All output is displayed on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes.

*Code Contributed* : [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/functional/yash-chowdhary.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/yash-chowdhary.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Remove Group Command

==== External Behavior

---
#Start of Extract (from User Guide)#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=removegroup]

#End of Extract (from User Guide)#

---

==== Justification

---
If a sub-committee of a club is no longer required, the `Exco` members can delete the group from the app.
This changes the group of all the members (previously part of the deleted group) to the default group - `Member`.

=== Justification

Members of a club have certain responsibilities and must carry out tasks to fulfil their responsibilities. Furthermore, `EXCO` members can delegate tasks to other members which they must perform within a stipulated time period.
Maintaining a record of tasks is crucial as it help maintain transparency and accountability of the club.

=== Proposed Enhancement: Data Encryption

===== External Behaviour

Implementing this feature will have no effect on the functionality that `Club Connect` provides to its users. The major change that this feature will bring is securing user data. +
Users can rest assured that none of their data is leaked to malicious foreign parties.

===== Justification

Data privacy is a hot topic in today's world. When personal data falls into the wrong hands, it can be misused in ways we couldn't possibly imagine. Every corporation, organization and service must provide data privacy not only because it's the law, but also to maintain consumer satisfaction.

===== Implementation

#Start of Extract (from Developer Guide)#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=dataencryption1]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=dataencryption2]

== Project: NUS Sports Update

=== Overview
The main source of motivation behind this project is the lack of real time organized information regarding sports events on campus – fixtures, timings, and (most importantly) results. The app also seeks to eliminate the use of Google forms and other unofficial means of signing up. Live-scores and fixtures help engage more students in the sports events around campus and improve the reach of these events.
